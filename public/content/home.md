# Hello! I'm Jordi, father of twins and currently living in Vilanova i la Geltr√∫.

Thanks for your time reading that, just would let you know about my daily life, working as a **fullstack developer**, focused more on client side as **JavaScript** pillar of my duties. As **NextJS** provides strong power to create full stack apps, I use regularly to work with client and server components.

Outside of work, I have a strong interest in **cibersecurity** and **artifical intelligence and llm**. I've been learning a bit more, every day, about privacity and proper web and network security, playing and making my own python scripts. I keep up with the latest trends and developments in the field to better understand how to safeguard systems and data. This knowledge complements my work and personal projects, helping me approach problems with a security-conscious mindset.
In terms of usages, **OSINT tools** and virtual machines serves me as a playgrounds to learn third party tools to make some **scans or IDS** controls.

I have an understanding of various network protocols and the **OSI model**. Specifically, I am knowledgeable about protocols such as TCP, ICMP, and IP, CIDR anotations, as other related. I am familiar with how these protocols operate at different layers of the network stack to ensure reliable communication, error handling, and data routing across networks.
