# Deporunners Hybrid App

Hybrid App, created with **Ionic** and **Capacitor** technologies, using React framework. It is being used by at least 150 users nowadays, with interactive list working on cache and invalidations managements.
That App is published into Play Store and App Store.

I have to work with some important mobile permissions:
- Push notifications
- Background runner
- Http requests
- File system
- Cookies ( Preferences on Capacitor )
